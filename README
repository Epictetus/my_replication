MyReplication
=============

MyReplication is an extention of the existing rails' mysql database adapter that is designed to help applications switch connection to another database server in a replication database system.



Installation
=============

rails plugin install git@github.com:minhnghivn/my_replication.git

Configuration
=============

You need to specify a master database along with replicated ones in database.yml. For example:

development:
  adapter: mysql
  database: masterdb
  pool: 5
  username: minhnghivn
  password: secret
  host: localhost
  replicas:
    - database: replica001
      username: minhnghivn
      password: secret
      host: localhost
    - database: replica002
      username: minhnghivn
      password: secret
      host: localhost

Example
=============

Use replication block to switch database connection to one of the replicated databases (do not connect to the master one) and then execute the statement inside the block

User.replication do   
  list = User.all
end
